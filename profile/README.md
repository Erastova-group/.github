# Welcome to our GitHub!

We are a research group at the [School of Chemistry](https://www.chem.ed.ac.uk), the University of Edinburgh.

Our interest is in getting to know what molecular compositions and structures make natural materials so unique, 
and how can we use them for the benefit of our society.

We are molecular modelers, and therefore, often develop codes and software to assist with the setup and analysis of our data,
we also gather information into databases and build complex molecular systems.

We value data transparency and believe in open science, and so we are keen to share our efforts and outputs, which you will find here.
